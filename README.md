### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tian Xia. I am currently a postdoc in UTHealth Houston, with my focus on unsupervised deep learning on MRI images for genetic discovery. I had my Ph.D. from the Quantitative & Computational Biosciences program at Baylor College of Medicine. My Ph.D. thesis focus is developing computational approaches to analyze imaging data of mouse reproductive system and activity. Other than thesis projects, I have extensive experience in data science, machine learning, and computational biology.
